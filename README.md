Baby Store - Project Documentation
Adding a New Product
To add a new product to your baby store and create a checkout page for it, follow these steps:

1. Create a New Product Page
Copy an existing product page (e.g., product1.html, product2.html, or product3.html).
Rename the file appropriately to reflect the new product (e.g., product4.html).
Update the content within the new file to represent the new product:
Change the <title> tag to the new product name.
Update the <img> tag src attribute to the new product image and adjust the alt text.
Modify the product description and price in the <p> tags.
2. Create a New Checkout Page
Similar to creating a product page, copy an existing checkout page (e.g., checkout_product1.html).
Rename the new file (e.g., checkout_product4.html).
Update the details within the file to correspond to the new product:
Adjust the text that describes the product being purchased.
Update the price information.
3. Link the Product Page to the New Checkout Page
In your new product page (product4.html), update the <a> tag that links to the checkout page to point to your new checkout page (checkout_product4.html).
How the Code Works
The project utilizes simple HTML pages to represent a storefront and individual checkout processes. Each product has a dedicated product page and a corresponding checkout page.

Product Pages: Display the product image, description, and a link to add the product to the cart and proceed to checkout.
Checkout Pages: Confirm the product purchase details, including price and a thank you message.

Proposed Improvements
Dynamic Content Management: Implement a server-side solution (e.g., using PHP, Node.js) to dynamically generate product and checkout pages from a database.
CSS Styling: Introduce external CSS stylesheets to improve the UI/UX design across all pages.
JavaScript Enhancements: Use JavaScript to manage cart functionalities dynamically, including adding items, removing items, and updating the cart in real time.
Responsive Design: Ensure that all pages are responsive and look good on all devices by using responsive design techniques like CSS media queries.
Exploring Modern Frameworks: For developers interested in advancing the project with modern development frameworks, consider exploring projects that use Next.js on GitHub. These projects can provide insights into building more scalable and efficient applications.
